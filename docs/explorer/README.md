# Explorer Reference Implementation

Repository: https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/explorer/tree/suzuka

This implementation is a modified version of the Aptos explorer.

`AptosClient` and `Types` from the [Aptos TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk) provide methods and types for interacting with Movement Network Testnet.
